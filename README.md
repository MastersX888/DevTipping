# DevTipping

Support open-source developers with cryptocurrency tips via Ethereum!

**DevTipping** is a decentralized tipping platform built on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet. Developers register their GitHub usernames, and anyone can send them ETH tips directly to their wallet, with a small platform fee supporting the project.

## Features
- **GitHub Integration**: Link your GitHub username to your ETH address.
- **Easy Tipping**: Send tips in ETH via a simple web interface.
- **Transparent Fees**: 3% platform fee on each tip (configurable by the owner).
- **Withdraw Anytime**: Developers can withdraw their tips to their wallet.

## How It Works
1. **Register**: Connect MetaMask (Sepolia) and link your GitHub username on the site.
2. **Tip**: Enter a GitHub username, amount in ETH, and send via MetaMask.
3. **Withdraw**: Developers can claim their tips anytime.

## Tech Stack
